# ThemeScheduler
Switch KDE themes at a desired schedule.

This project aims to create a program that can act as a theme switcher for KDE Plasma. My aim is to make it so that the program switches between a dark during the night, and a light theme during the day, but the idea is that you can set it to automatically switch to the themes you want at the time you want.
